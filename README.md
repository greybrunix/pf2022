Anyways this is a collection of the resolution of the 2021/2022 exercises for the Functional Programming, I can assure most of this is correct

## Don't be a jackass
This is an educational repository, the point of this is to learn haskell/the ins and outs of Functional Programming as according to the classes' "prograssion" and to serve as a way to correct/clear up doubts on the exercises provided, don't use this to copy/cheat in tests, I will not be held responsible for y'all being lazy and not wanting to learn :wink:.

In other words, I do not care what you do with this repository, but I will not be held accountable for any bad faith on the part of any user.
